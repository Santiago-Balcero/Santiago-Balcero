- 👋 Hi, I’m @Santiago-Balcero from Bogotá, Colombia. Anthropologist and photographer I have now decided to focus in programming.
- 👀 I’m interested in learning the fundamentals of programming, big data from users in cultural venues, AI and more.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and basics of programming and development with an intensive (800 hours) course by Colombia's government.

- 📫 You can reach me via santiagobalcero@gmail.com or my photography web site https://santiagobalcero.myportfolio.com
